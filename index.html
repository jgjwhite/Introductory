            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Senior Product Designer with 7 years of experience across startups, big tech, and agencies. A consistent theme throughout my career has been designing for how people get work done more effectively and more enjoyably. I transitioned into design through the YSDN program, where I completed a degree in design. Since then, I&apos;ve worked in proptech and construction tech startups, and at an agency where I led design on contracts for Meta and Lululemon. These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to better design, test, and measure whether software truly meets, and exceeds, customer needs.</p>
